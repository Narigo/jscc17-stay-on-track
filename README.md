# jscc17-stay-on-track
# What are the questions?
- Is it obligatory to stay on track?
- What are the sources of cutting edge technologies?
- How is should the evaluation look like?
- What are the differences between personal and business purposes?

## Sources
- Ask younger colleuges, that are deep into it. But take care of *conformation bias*! Spread your view and leave your comfort zone!
- Mettups, Conferences
  - Conferences are very specialized, so we have to find the ones are fitting best to our purposes
- Hype Cycle for Application Development 2016 (Gartner)
- Medium blog posts
- There are communities! Have in mind that there are local and virtual groups connected. And they are losely connected to each others, even if they do not have to do with each others (Design, Programming, Management etc.)

## Evaluation

### Example projects
- Take a existing project with a given technology stack and change some components and check the results and advices of co-workers

### Tutorial Videos
- Bad for evaluation, but good for overview
- Missing deeper view on a specific topic

### Direct communication channels **needed**
- Twitter, Blogs

## Mandatory VS free?
- It is *best practice* to have free time in company time for spreading the view and put focus on new technologies
  - Review talks are important to evaluate the results and give advice to other colleagues
  - Slack days/Google days etc.

## Different necessaties

### Personal
- It is absolutely necessary to spread your view and try new architacture, languages, framework, if you do not want to close the gap of a niche technology

### Company
- Technology Leadership is risky, because putting the decision power only into one person is
  - Otherwise be honest and tell, if you do not know the correct answer
- *Long term support* needed
- Processes and decisions are way longer
- Reasoning! Alternatives should be reasoned
  - A clear indicator for the need of changing technology stack is, when you cannot find developers anymore
  - Important and central personalities are switching to other technologies

### Further topics
- Dying components, how to track on them?
- Why are there so many frameworks?
  - Publishing is easy, small boundaries
  - Understanding others code is sometimes harder than write a own new framework
- JS Core enbetterment VS new JS frameworks
